**MATLAB implementation of our crowd anomaly detection algorithm.**

The provided code is in content-obscure (p) form, it is provided to facilitate the review process of our article. Complete code will be uploaded after acceptance of our article.

Use **batch_run.m** to train and test the algorithm on the UCSD dataset. You have to download the UCSD crowd anomaly dataset (http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/projects/anomaly/dataset.html) and provide the path to dataset in batch_run.m. 

**Dependencies:**

We have used Quaternion and octonion toolbox for Matlab (QTFM) toolbox. Download it from  https://qtfm.sourceforge.io/ and add the path to MATLAB.
